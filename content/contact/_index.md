  My office is <strong>CBA 6.478</strong> in the Business School. This is somewhat hard to find: it’s on the 6th floor of the south wing of CBA, on the east side of the building, i.e. on the side facing Speedway and Gregory Gym. The easiest way to get there is to go up the elevators in CBA (not the ones in GSB). When you reach the 6th floor, walk straight ahead under the sign for “Behavioral Lab,” turn left, and continue following the hall as it bends to the right until you find my office.<br><br>
  <em>NB: I have nothing to do with the Behavioral Lab, although I’ve had students remark that finding my office feels like a behavioral experiment.</em>

  You can sometimes find me instead in <strong>GDC 7.516</strong> in the Statistics Department. This is on the 7th floor of the north tower of GDC. Take the elevators on the north side, i.e. on the side of the central atrium opposite the little coffee shop.
